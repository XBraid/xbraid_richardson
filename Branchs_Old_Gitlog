     Added the calling function to all status structures. When doing adaptation it is nice to know what function is calling the step status, so that we can complete the error estimation process only one time per iteration.

    Added the communication minimzation feature. When this is set true,
    the first point on any processor must be a C-point. The idea is that
    splitting coarse grid intervals up across time processors does not
    give us anything.

    - Fixed some discrepancies between ex-03, ex-03-serial and driver-diffusion-2D.c
      regarding how CFL numbers were treated
    - Fixed a small bug in drive-diffusion-2D regarding how PFMG iterations
      were tracked and how max-pfmg-iter was enforced (basically, A_idx and level
      were not equal when skip was used).
    - Removed the "RDF Hack" that put F-refinement in ex-03.  We now use
      ex-01-refinement.c for our regression testing of F-refinement

    This commit does a major re-working of the structure of the examples and

    - Fixed a couple small bugs, like setting tstart in the C++ interface
    - Removed comments in _braid_status.c, that were duplicate from braid_status.h
    - Moved a few things from braid_status.h to _braid_status.h that weren't
      user interface related

    Merge pull request #7 in XBRAID/xbraid from status-facto to master
    
    * commit 'e582086445bfc2ed25c9afd7bee4edae05556287':
      Modifies the SetRSpace. Since now core == status, we have to implement this differently (i.e. directly in the SetRSpace)
      Remove the _braid_DeriveStatusElt, which is replaced by _braid_StatusElt. Also, move a typedef to the appropriate header.
      Moves all the properties of _braid_Status_struct to the core. Now _braid_Status_struct inherits from _braid_Core_struct.
      Change the name of the BufferStatus property "size" to "size_buffer"
      Temporary state with the new header file _braid_status.h, that contains the actual implementation of the _braid_*Status_struct. This step is required for the next step, which will be to merge the _braid_Status_struct  into _braid_Core_struct.
      Removes the intermediate structure GlobalStatus. Now, all *Status derivate from the main structure _braid_Status so that they can be easily cast between each other. In braid, we only have one braid_Status, the other astatus, bstatus, cstatus and sstatus are the same structure cast into different types.
      Change the headers and functions of the accessors for the derived *Status to macros. This way, when adding a new parameter in the Status, only only need to implement the global accessor and add one macro call per derived accessor.
      Modification of the status implementation. We now have one main structure _braid_Status_struct wich is a merge of all the previous *Status. All the other status structures now contain only a pointer to this main status structure. A new structure called _braid_GlobalStatus_struct appears (and also contains only a pointer to the main status structure). This new structure allows the user to access properties that he would normally not be able to access, by casting the *Status given to him by XBraid into this GlobalStatus. All accessors have been implemented, with very few API changes: - for StepStatus, GetTstart becomes GetT for uniformization purposes - for *Status, GetIStop becomes GetTIndex, and always return the index   in ta such that ta[GetTIndex()] == GetT(). This was not consistent   so far (in StepStatus, we had tstop, in AccessStatus, we had t)
      Change the names of some funciton argument to avoid collision with free()...

    Temporary state with the new header file _braid_status.h, that contains
    the actual implementation of the _braid_*Status_struct. This step is
    required for the next step, which will be to merge the _braid_Status_struct
     into _braid_Core_struct.

    Removes the intermediate structure GlobalStatus. Now, all *Status
    derivate from the main structure _braid_Status so that they can be
    easily cast between each other. In braid, we only have one braid_Status,
    the other astatus, bstatus, cstatus and sstatus are the same structure
    cast into different types.

    Change the headers and functions of the accessors for the derived
    *Status to macros. This way, when adding a new parameter in the Status,
    only only need to implement the global accessor and add one macro
    call per derived accessor.

    Modification of the status implementation. We now have one main structure
    _braid_Status_struct wich is a merge of all the previous *Status.
    All the other status structures now contain only a pointer to this
    main status structure. A new structure called _braid_GlobalStatus_struct
    appears (and also contains only a pointer to the main status structure).
    This new structure allows the user to access properties that he would
    normally not be able to access, by casting the *Status given to him by
    XBraid into this GlobalStatus.
    All accessors have been implemented, with very few API changes:
    - for StepStatus, GetTstart becomes GetT for uniformization purposes
    - for *Status, GetIStop becomes GetTIndex, and always return the index
      in ta such that ta[GetTIndex()] == GetT(). This was not consistent
      so far (in StepStatus, we had tstop, in AccessStatus, we had t)
    
    XBraid compiles and pass the tests. But these modifications have not
    been heavily tested. Note that the c++ wrappers are probably out-to-date
    and miss some accessors, but should still work.

    Removal of extra comma in some functions argument lists, that prevented
     from compiling the fortran interface of spatial coarsening and
    refinement. There are still warnings to be addressed.

    Had to change how ex-01f is compiled in the regression test so that
    the Fortran warnings about the unused app parameter are ignored.  The
    app has to be a part of the interface (obviously), but for such a simple
    example, it isn't always used.

      Added: Regression test for ex-01/ex-01f testing the user-defined fine time grid feature. Added: braid_access_status_get_istop in Fortran interface. Bugfix: ex-01f now queries access status to determine filename index as we don't have dt = const, in general.

      Added: Fortran interface to enable user supplied fine time grid. Modified: Pass values by reference so we have interoperability for C/Fortran. Modified: ex-01f now demonstrates how to define a fine time grid. Bugfix: Set initial tgrid function pointer to NULL. Todo: Use macros for passing data to Fortran in braid_TimeGrid_F90_Iface.
      Introduced an option for the user to supply an initial fine grid. The use of this option is demonstrated in examples/ex-01.c I added an index in AccessStatus/StepStatus to simplify output to files based on time point index value. Since we know the index in braid, this makes it easier for the user to assign a correct file name.

    Merge pull request #2 in XBRAID/xbraid from shellvector to master
    
    * commit '462a55c45500c17b9993eded035acdb48073bfd2':
      Adds a comment to describe the problem solved in ex-bdf2
      Change interface of _braid_UGetIndex. The function now returns two integers. One is the local index if something (shell or vector) is stored or -1 if nothing is stored. The second is a flag indicating the storage status: 0 if it's a full vector, -1 if it's a shell, and -2 if nothing is stored.
      Following Jacob's suggestion, adds some more explicit comments, rename a variable and correct indentation
      Adds a verification on the number of my_Access calls for different access level parameter (0 to 3).
      Adds an example using the shellvector feature. It's a simple 1D linear problem using a BDF2 method. I have added the associated test script and expected results.
      Adds and modifies comments to reflect the new shell feature and the new access levels
      Removes tabs and correction of indentation
      Re-add the access_level variable in braid_Drive that has been removed during merge, but that I still use.
      Modification of the access_level. Now, we have: - access_level == 0 : do nothing - access_level == 1 : call at the end of the simulation (fine grid) - access_level == 2 : call at the end of each iteration and end of simulation (fine grid only) - access_level == 3 : same as other, plus call in FRestrict, FInterp and FRefine (on all levels).
      Adds a missing initialization of sfree to NULL when not using shell vectors. Normally this initialization is useless.
      Correction of two bugs. The first is in FRefine, the array r_ta now as a size of r_npoints+2, to have r_npoints[-1] and r_npoints[r_npoints]. We need these values when doind spatial refinement. The second is in _braid_InitHierarchy, if very few points so that only one level is built, then core.max_levels is not reset to 1 anymore.
      Bug of missing shell after refining. Now all points from coarse grid  are passed to th new coarse point on refined grid
      Modifications to use shell vectors when possible. When the shell feature is activated, U Vectors are saved on all points in time ( C- and F-points ).  On C-points, vectors are full, and on F-points only the shell structure is  saved. It is up to the used to define InitShell, CloneShell and FreeShell. I think only full vectors are communicated between processors, so no modification of the *Buffer functions are required. Apparently work with my code...
      First modifications to take into account the shell structure of braid vectors. Does not modify anything in the algorithm yet.

      Bug fix: FRefine stalls if there are more processors than there are new time steps on the new fine grid. Tracked it down to these f_next and f_first values. If a processor has zero time points on the new fine grid then f_next doesnt get initialized. This causes recv_msg and send_msg to be set on that processor even though it have no points

commit 400228fb7ed367deaea684c3f94805c47e33f8eb
Author: O'neill <oneill10@mollow.llnl.gov>
Date:   Thu May 12 10:21:03 2016 -0700

    Set size_ptr prior to calling bufpack such that: size_ptr = 0 @ entry
    to bufpack indicates the message will be used for completing a time
    step on the next processor. @entry size_ptr = 1 indicates the message
    will be used for load balenceing in FRefine.
    
    Reason: Far less information is needed when completing a time step
            than when moving an entire vector to a new processor. In my
            case each vector saves its entire spatial heirachy of meshes.
            To complete a time step on the next processor the message only
            needs to contain the current function and the current mesh. To
            move an entire vector to a new processor the message must contain
            the fine grid solution and mesh + all other coarse grid messages.

commit 2820b12b2137d36c80316fa61fcef4321577ff1f
Author: O'neill <oneill10@mollow.llnl.gov>
Date:   Thu May 12 09:38:46 2016 -0700

    Added Functionality that allows for spatial refinement following a
    Vcycle. Currently the user can only complete spatial refinement following
    a Vcycle if temporal refinement is also completed. Using the StepStatus
    struct the user can set the flag r_space. Follwing the Vcycle, if refine is
    turned on, no temporal refinment was completed (globally), and r_space > 0 for
    some local time step, then the users spatial refinment routine is called at all
    local time points. An MPI_AllReduce checks to see if spatial refinement was completed
    on any processor. If yes then the *refined_ptr returns 2 and the Vcycle is repeated, if
    not, then *refined_ptr returns 0 and braid moves onto the next Vcycle.

    Moved the additional "hypre" functions from drive-04.cpp to hypre_extra.hpp, so
    they can be used in other drivers.
    
    Added a number of options to drive-05: implicit time stepping; different options
    for the implicit solver; a switch between second (diffusion) and fourth order
    dissipation terms; random initialization for the initial vectors, etc.
    
    Some formatting edits.

    In the build system, added support for compiling the mfem examples using any
    external packages that mfem was configured with, e.g. SuiteSparse.
    
    Also, iclude makefile.user (if present) from makefile.inc -- this is just
    another way for users or developers to configure braid without modifying
    makefile.inc.

    Modification of the access_level. Now, we have:
    - access_level == 0 : do nothing
    - access_level == 1 : call at the end of the simulation (fine grid)
    - access_level == 2 : call at the end of each iteration and end of simulation (fine grid only)
    - access_level == 3 : same as other, plus call in FRestrict, FInterp and FRefine (on all levels).
    
    Also, I have added information in the AccessStatus structure about
    where the Access function has been called (FInterp, FRestrict, FRefine or FAccess)

    This is a better fix for doing access_level==0 and max_levels==0, which was
    the case that Veselin found that was buggy.  My previous commit broke the
    functionality of FRefine(), where you want the coarsest level to be solved
    sequentially.

    Fixed a bug in braid_GetSpatialAccuracy() due to Rob's earlier
    change to explicitly store rnorms[0] = -1.0 if the skip option is
    turned on.  Storing in rnorms this way makes sense, but
    braid_GetSpatialAccuracy() wasn't expecting a -1.0.

    Correction of two bugs. The first is in FRefine, the array r_ta now
    as a size of r_npoints+2, to have r_npoints[-1] and r_npoints[r_npoints].
    We need these values when doind spatial refinement. The second is in
    _braid_InitHierarchy, if very few points so that only one level is built,
    then core.max_levels is not reset to 1 anymore.

    Modifications to use shell vectors when possible. When the shell feature
    is activated, U Vectors are saved on all points in time ( C- and F-points ).
     On C-points, vectors are full, and on F-points only the shell structure is
     saved. It is up to the used to define InitShell, CloneShell and FreeShell.
    I think only full vectors are communicated between processors, so no
    modification of the *Buffer functions are required. Apparently work with my code...

    Fixed some bugs in _braid.c and especially in _braid_GetUInit() regarding
    the various storage options, where storage=-2 is compatability mode with
    old braid, and -1 and 0 use more current information.  There is a long comment
    at the top of FRestrict() that outline some of the reasoning behind the issues
    addressed in this commit.
    
    To test the bug fixes a new option was added braid_SetSeqSoln() which allows
    the user to initialize the problem with the solution from sequential time stepping.
    This is there just for debugging, but can be quite useful.

    Adding new option to skip all work on the down cycle.  This is now the default
    option in Braid.  It can be toggled, though, with the "braid_SetSkip" option.
    
    I also cleaned up how the core->rnorms array is accessed with three new accessor
    functions
      _braid_AppendResidual
      _braid_GetRNorm
      _braid_DeleteLasResidual
    The number of residual norms available depends on the skip option and the
    iteration number.  Sometimes there are resdiual norms available, sometimes not.
    And the number available does not equal the number of iterations.  So, these
    functions make all that easier.

    Updated the debug residual norm printing where the individual
    residual norm for each C-point is printed out.  Previously, the
    output was printed by every individual processor, leading to values
    being duplicated to the braid output stream, and to the braid output
    stream having way too many processors write to it.  Now, the global
    rank 0 collects all the information, and prints the individual residual
    norms in order.

    A few changes to allow the code to run with F-only-relaxation, a case
    where (possibly) not all rfactor values are updated before the first call
    to FRefine.  Also, the Residual function did not update rfactor after the
    call to the user's step(), which was a bug.

    Woops...the GetSpatialAccuracy function is now a member of the BraidUtil

commit f2d96dc15db7225d2ff5117c87e80aefb51265b7
Author: Jacob Schroder <schroder2@llnl.gov>
Date:   Wed Jul 15 09:30:58 2015 -0700

    Continued work on the new version of the accuracy handle.  Here, I
    more thoroughly integrated the storage of an rnorms array and a
    current iteration count in the Core object into Braid.  So, this
    meant that rnorm and iter parameters were no longer needed by
      _braid_FRestrict
      _braid_FInterp
      _braid_FAccess
      _braid_FRefine
    
    This also simplified some of the rnorm and old_rnorm storage in
    the Drive() function.
    
    This also led to a change in the braid_GetRNorms() function, which
    now allows the user to request arbitrary segments of the residual
    history, after Drive() is called.

Author: Jacob Schroder <schroder2@llnl.gov>
Date:   Mon Jul 13 15:55:53 2015 -0700

    A few small logic changes
    
      default min_coarse is now 2 (previously was 3)
    
      a residual norm of 0.0 no longer is a condition for halting
    
      a negative tolerance is no longer a condition for halting,
      such a tolerance now means the code will run to max_iter
    
      if the original grid size is below min_coarse, then a single
      level solver is used

Date:   Mon Jul 13 10:28:44 2015 -0700

    Removed the old (now unused) accuracy handled.  It was hard-coded into
    the Braid code and needed to be removed.  Also removed the experimental
    step_type parameter from StepStatus structure.  This parameter, it turns
    out, raised fixed point iteration issues and was not "safe".

    Added a compatibility mode for the storage flag.  If storage is
    -2, then run as if using the old, original Braid algorithm.  Never
    give the user the stored values at C-points.  This will be an extra
    for experts option. If storage is -1, then store, and give to the user,
    the stored C-point values.  If storage is 0 or greater, then the functionality
    is unchanged.

    Added new function braid_SetDefaultPrintFile, primarily for fortran codes.
    It is difficult to pass strings (i.e., filenames) from fortran to C in a machine
    independent way.  So, this function just sets the braid runtime output to all go
    to a file name braid_runtime.out.

    Added check regarding nprocs > npoints.  Currently, braid does not
    handle having more processors on the fine grid than there are points
    in time.  Eventually, we will change this, especially as we allow for
    adaptivity in time.  But for now, this change avoids a sigFPE error.

    First version of the Fortran interface.  Currently, it is turned on
    manually in braid.h with 3 pound-defines at the top of that file.
    One pound-define turns on the interface, another pound-define chooses
    your name-mangling option and the third pound define turns on spatial
    coarsening in Fortran.
    
    There is also an examples/ex-01f.f90 which is a fortran90 analogue of
    ex-01.c.  They do the same thing.

Date:   Mon Mar 9 16:53:05 2015 -0700

    Many changes, but all related to the examples and drivers
    
    - The drivers directory was split into "examples" and "drivers"
    
    - examples holds simple user-friendly examples.  Currently that's
    ex-01 and ex-02, a scalar ODE and heat equation example, respectively.
    
    - ex-02 is a simplified example that only does backward Euler and corresponds
    to ex-02-serial which is a mock-up of a simple user application that we
    parallelize in time with ex-02.
    
    - drivers holds more sophisticated drivers that we use for research
      This is where all the old drivers (drive-02, drive-03, drive-04,
      drive-05 and hyperdrive) ended up.
    
    - The old drive-02 was eliminated, and replaced by the old drive-05.
    These drivers duplicated functionality.
    
    - Associated regression tests were added for the new examples

Author: Jacob Schroder <schroder2@llnl.gov>
Date:   Fri Jan 9 20:26:45 2015 -0800

    Updated drive-05 to handle spatial parallelism.  Before, drive-05 handled
    spatial coarsening, but did not allow for parallelism in space.  This is
    now fixed.  The interface to drive-05 has also been modified to allow for
    level specific CFL targets which guide the spatial coarsening rate.  Also,
    associated regression tests were added to test the new functionality of drive-05.

    Added a new member "wrapper_test" to the AccessStatus structure.
    This boolean flag indicates whether Access is being called from a
    wrapper test or from an actual Braid run.  This is useful in Strand
    where the wrapper tests do sanity screen printing during the wrapper tests,
    but something more sophisticated during actual runs.

Author: Jacob Schroder <schroder2@llnl.gov>
Date:   Wed Sep 17 12:05:55 2014 -0700

    Updated the C++ wrapper
    
    - Changed the test routine wrappers to automatically use the _BraidApp**()
    functions. This makes the test routine interfaces in C++ cleaner
    
    - Changed the braid_Core wrapper to use braid_Int and braid_Real, not int
    and double
    
    - Changed the way the status structures are wrapped.  Now, the _BraidApp**()
    routines do the conversion from the C structure "braid_**Status" to
    the C++ object "Braid**Status".  This way the user routines don't have to do
    this conversion.
    
    - Moved the Coarsen and Refine routines into the App structure.  They work
    the same way as all the other function Phi, Clone, and so on.  Except, these
    functions are only virtual, meanining that their definition is optional.  The
    default implementation just calls clone.
    
    - Drive-04 has been changed to accommodate this update

    Moved the C++ wrapper classes for Braid from examples/drive-04.cpp to braid.hpp.
    
    This required some interface changes:
    
    - BraidApp, in braid.hpp, is now an abstract base class with purely virtual
      functions for Phi(), Clone(), etc.
    
    - The corresponding "C" functions that are passed to Braid are defined outside
      of the class, with names like _BraidAppPhi(), and assume that their _app
      argument is of type BraidApp*. These are the functions references in the
      BraidCore class.
    
    - MFEMBraidApp inherits BraidApp in drive-04.cpp and implements its virtual
      functions.
    
    - The classes BraidAccessStatus, BraidPhiStatus, BraidCoarsenRefStatus and
      BraidUtil remain the same.

    Added CoarsenRefStatus wrapper to drive-04

commit a73d6f0aaf0bb34261878a3173fab854a27a09e4
Author: Jacob Schroder <schroder2@llnl.gov>
Date:   Thu Aug 21 17:24:28 2014 -0700

    Changed the Coarsen, Refine and Phi interfaces to be flexible and take a status structure as their argument.  The user will now get information like tstart, tstop and so on from GetTstart(status, &tstart) type calls.  I've changed the interface too many times in the past...and this will make future changes much easier.

commit cc545c8b05a0bebb9f8f9945b568aaadc775d491
Author: Jacob Schroder <schroder2@llnl.gov>
Date:   Thu Aug 21 13:18:37 2014 -0700

    Renamed Status to AccessStatus, and moved AccessStatus to the Core Structure to avoid re-allocating it.  Next, will come PhiStatus and CoarsenRefineStatus, which will mirror AccessStatus

commit 1b166d03d239ede2dc7f16a1e630d9de35349a26
Author: Jacob Schroder <schroder2@llnl.gov>
Date:   Thu Aug 21 10:08:19 2014 -0700

    Moved braid_Status structures/routines to separate file.  Next will come braid_PhiStatus, braid_CoarsenRefineStatus, braid_AccessStatus structures and their associated get/set routines.  This will be a lot of lines...and putting them all in a separate file makes sense.

Date:   Wed Aug 20 17:25:47 2014 -0700

    Changed the dot function to residdot per a group discussion long ago.  This function is only used for residual dot products and this new name makes that apparent.  The user may want a non-Eucliden a inner-product, and this function lets the user have a function devoted solely to computing the residual norm

    Added a SetPrintFile() function and capability to redirect printf output to a user-defined file.
    This is useful in settings when user code prints to stdout with no easy way to turn it off in a parallel
    setting (e.g., sequential user code) except to redirect stdout to /dev/null.

commit 48966b2e00292e5eca3079848325d5c148a81627
Author: Jacob Schroder <schroder2@llnl.gov>
Date:   Wed Feb 19 15:24:01 2014 -0800

    Changed the option in drive-04 that runs just a single warp_test.  Now,
    just a single test is run, and that output is piped to GLVIS or to the screen,
    depending on whether that test uses the write function.  To run other
    warp tests (like TestSum, or TestDot), the user will have to comment in that
    test, recompile and then run.  I think that this is how a typical user will
    use these individual tests.
    
    The user can still do warp_TestAll in drive-04 to run all the tests at once
    and get a boolean pass/fail flag.

    by reference.  This will make for a little cleaner code.

Date:   Thu Jan 23 11:50:01 2014 -0800

    Added new functionality for FWrite.  Essentially, a new structure called warp_Status is passed as a parameter to the user's write function.  The user then uses warp query functions like warp_GetStatusLevel(warp_Status status) to find out what level they're on.  This is a fairly extensible approach to giving the user more info in their write function.  Also, there is a new function warp_SetWriteLevel which sets how often the user's write function is called (0: only at the end, 1: every time FRestrict is called)

    fixed a small bug in the spatial interpolation in drive-05.  Then, I had to update diffusion2.saved for the regression tests to reflect the new driver.  Last, I changed the memcheck-tux-jacob.sh regression test because there was an issue related to valgrind error messages being in an unpredictable unordered in parallel.  Note printing to standard error with valgrind did not fix the problem.

Date:   Mon Nov 25 17:23:32 2013 -0800

    Changes in examples/drive-04.cpp:
    
     - Added MFEM support for a class of implicit time integrators and incorporated
       them in the example.
    
     - Extended the classes ScalarODE and LinearSystemODE to support the implicit
       time integrators. The time-dependent and non-linear Phi in the ScalarODE
       class appear to work with warp.
    
     - Modified the GLVis visualization in WarpApp::Write to show the solution at
       the final time. Intermediate warp iterations will also be visualized if the
       "write (visualize) intermediate warp iterations" code in warp_Drive is
       enabled.
    
     - Added MFEM support for time-dependent coefficients and used them to define
       time-dependent boundary conditions and source terms.
    
     - Added an exact solution and printing of the L2 error at the final time.
    
     - Added ParCSRMatrix functions for adding matrices and setting values.
    
     - Switched to zero (not random) values in the WarpApp::Init method.
    
     - Added command line options similar to the other drivers.

Date:   Wed Nov 13 19:49:52 2013 -0800

    Moved the drivers in a new examples/ directory.
    
    Changed the main Makefile: now it builds a separate WARP library file,
    libwarp.a. The drivers are built by the examples/Makefile. Usage:
      'make'                        --> build the library,
      'make examples' or 'make all' --> build the library and the drivers,
      'make clean'                  --> clean the library and the drivers.
    
    Renamed the CC and CXX variable to MPICC and MPICXX to allow customization
    by setting the environment.

    FRestrict() to use "high accuracy" (accuracy = 0).  Maybe this isn't the best
    name for this parameter, but we can change later.
